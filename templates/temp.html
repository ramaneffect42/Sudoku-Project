                <h3>Hackathon 1: HackHorizons by WHHC</h3>
                <p>I took part in HackHorizons with the goal of creating a practical tool to support students in their
                    academic journey.
                    The result was a dynamic study-buddy web application that goes beyond simple information retrieval.
                    It's designed to act as a personal
                    tutor, allowing a student to pose a question and receive a detailed, well-structured answer. What
                    makes this application particularly
                    effective is its ability to understand the user's educational background and tailor the response
                    accordingly, ensuring the information is
                    always relevant and easy to grasp. To provide a holistic learning experience, the app also
                    intelligently curates and suggests a list of
                    relevant videos, offering an alternative medium for understanding complex topics and fostering a
                    more well-rounded approach to studying.</p>

                <h3>Hackathon 2: Sustain-ai-thon in VITC</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Sustain-ai-thon, my teammate and I focused our efforts on tackling a critical
                    environmental issue: water pollution.
                    Our project involved building a web application that gives a voice to concerned citizens, empowering
                    them to contribute to a
                    larger ecological effort. The primary function of the app is ingeniously simple yet powerful: a user
                    can upload a photograph of a
                    polluted water body, and our custom-built model instantly analyzes the image. By examining the color
                    and clarity of the water,
                    the model provides a quantitative assessment of the pollution level. The vision for this tool was to
                    create a community-driven database
                    of environmental issues, with a planned feature to plot these locations on a map, providing
                    valuable,
                    real-time data to government and environmental agencies who could then take swift action.

                <h3>Hackathon 3: Nexathon in VITC</h3>
                <p>
                    For Nexathon, our team built a project centered on health and fitness. My core contribution was
                    developing a sophisticated computer
                    vision module that serves as a virtual personal trainer. The application allows users to upload a
                    video of themselves performing
                    exercises or yoga poses. The module then meticulously analyzes the video, using advanced techniques
                    to track and identify key points on
                    the user's body. By comparing the user's form to an ideal standard, the app provides precise,
                    constructive feedback, helping them correct
                    their posture and technique in order to maximize their workout's effectiveness and prevent injury.
                    While our initial ambitions included
                    implementing real-time feedback and a competitive leaderboard, the experience was invaluable,
                    pushing the boundaries of what we could achieve with computer vision and setting a clear roadmap for
                    future improvements.
