# Sudoku-Project
This is a Practice Project where i learnt the fundamentals of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It showcases multiple skills like:
1. Responsive Web Design
2. CSS Flexbox model and Media Queries
3. JavaScript Basics
4. Built with Basic Accessibility Features
5. Deployment on Vercel (free tier)

When Building this project, i first started making it as a desktop first project then started adding the media queries to make it responsive for mobile devices, however i have since learned that you can make the design mobile first then expand to desktop screen sizes. (max-width vs mi-width)
